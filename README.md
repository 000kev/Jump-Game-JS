# Wizard Jump
A jumping game using javascript, css and html similar to the t-rex game on google chrome.
A very basic version of the t-rex jumping game that allows you to jump over certain obstacles.
As the game progresses, the rate at which enemies approach speeds up so keep your finger ready!
Use space or the up key to jump.
